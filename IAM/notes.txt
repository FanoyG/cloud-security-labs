🔒 Local-Only Steps (Intentionally Not Committed)
  - Some steps in this lab are executed locally only and are not committed to GitHub.
  - This is intentional and aligns with real-world security practices.

1️⃣ IAM Access Key Creation (Local Only):- For demonstration purposes, an IAM access key is created locally using Terraform:

```
resource "aws_iam_access_key" "test_key" {
  user = aws_iam_user.test_user.name
}
```

⚠️ Important
    - This resource is required locally to generate access keys for the attack simulation
    - If this block is missing from iam.tf, Terraform will fail
    - Access keys are never committed and are destroyed after the demo
The generated credentials are used temporarily and stored in a local .env file.

2️⃣ Terraform Outputs (Intentionally Excluded)

Terraform outputs used to retrieve access keys are not committed.
Reason:
    - To avoid encouraging secret-exposure patterns
    - Secrets should never exist in version control

Outputs are retrieved locally using:
      ```
      terraform output
      ```
These values are then placed into a .env file for the Python attack simulation.

3️⃣ .env File (Runtime Only)
A .env file is used to store AWS credentials locally:
    ```
    AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=xxxxxxxx
    AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=xxxxxxxx
    AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=ap-south-1
    ```
  - .env is ignored via .gitignore
  - This mimics real-world credential leakage scenarios
  - Secrets are never committed

4️⃣ AWS Profile Configuration (Required)

In variables.tf, ensure the correct AWS CLI profile is set:
    ```
    variable "aws_profile" {
      description = "AWS CLI profile name used by Terraform"
    }
    ```

⚠️ Important
  - The profile must exist locally (aws configure --profile <name>)
  - Using the wrong or missing profile will cause Terraform errors

5️⃣ Cleanup (Mandatory)

After completing the demo, always destroy resources:
    ```
    terraform destroy
    ```

This ensures:
    - No long-lived credentials remain active
    - No accidental exposure
    - Good security hygiene
